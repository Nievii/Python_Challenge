# Python_Challenge
Assignment 3

In this challenge I have uploaded two coding scripts that reads and analyses the data sets in Pybank and Pypoll. After the analysis of the csv files I exported them into another folder which I accessed on terminal and using my git I pushed them so they can be viewed for marking.
